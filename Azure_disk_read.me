Azure disk enumeration nondeterminism

ðŸ”¥ The Root Cause
Azure assigns virtual SCSI devices dynamically, and /dev/sdX names depend on:

The order Linux detects disks

OS boot race conditions

Hotplug timing

That means:

/dev/sda might be your OS disk today

But it could become /dev/sdb or /dev/sdd after a reboot or image redeploy

âœ… The Correct Fix: Always Use UUID or LVM/VG Names
âœ… 1. Use UUID= in /etc/fstab
You must not rely on /dev/sdX in /etc/fstab or grub.cfg.

Instead, use:

bash
Copy
Edit
UUID=abc123...  /       ext4   defaults  0 1
UUID=def456...  /boot   ext4   defaults  0 2
Get UUIDs via:

bash
Copy
Edit
blkid
âœ… 2. Use /dev/disk/by-id/ or /dev/disk/by-uuid/ for scripting and automation
These are stable and mapped by Azureâ€™s disk metadata:

bash
Copy
Edit
ls -l /dev/disk/by-id/
ls -l /dev/disk/by-uuid/
You can use these in GRUB, fstab, or any automation.
